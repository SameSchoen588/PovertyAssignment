Pull File Data and reformat into new Directory

This was an assignment during my last semester of Java at NWTC Green Bay, WI. 

Here we have a program that is able to pull a file from a designated directory.

Knowing the format of the file, I can then pull the requested data from said file.

Then the requested data is formated accordingly (business rule) into a new file within a new directory. 

I also chose print the contents of the file and format it to be more eye-appealing to the console to prove it works.
