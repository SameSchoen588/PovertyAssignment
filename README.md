# Pull File Data and reformat into new Directory

This was an assignment during my last semester of Java at NWTC Green Bay, WI. - The Poverty Assignment


Here we have a program that is able to pull a file from a designated directory (poverty.txt).

Knowing the format of the file, I can then pull the requested data from said file.

Then the requested data is formated accordingly (business rule) into a new file within a new directory. 

I also chose print the contents of the file and format it to be more eye-appealing to the console to prove it works.

# How to import 
Most of my experience with Java has been through using eclipse ide.
Assuming you also are using eclipse if you need help importing these files into your workbench read the following steps:

1) First, always make sure you unzip of "Extract All" files wihtin a zip folder, and place it somewhere it is easy to locate (I recommend the desktop for this step).

2) Once in the eclipse ide workbench, go to File (in the upper left) -> Import.

3) Next you will be asked to make a selection of the type of file, you should find General -> Projects from Folder or Archive, and click next.

4) At the top of the box is the Import source textbox. Here, select the Directory button, locate the unzipped folder where you saved it (desktop was recommended for this reason), and click Finish.

5) You should now have the complete project at your disposal.

6) Check for locations of directories and file/folder names may need to be updated.
